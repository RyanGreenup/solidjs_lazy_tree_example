## Usage

# Adapted from https://github.com/themesberg/tailwind-solidjs-starter

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
